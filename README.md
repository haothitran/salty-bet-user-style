# Style for Salty Bet

A custom user style providing a more compact view of [Salty Bet](http://www.saltybet.com/) by moving the bets panel over to the right column beneath the chat panel. This reduces the default three-column interface to two-columns, and assumes user does not closely monitor the bets panel.

Intended to be used with a short width browser window, such as when a monitor is in vertical orientation.
